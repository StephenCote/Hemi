Hemi JavaScript Framework

If you just want to start using the framework, download a copy of the project from GitHub and copy everything from ./Hemi/src/Hemi to your local Web server.  The ./Hemi/src/Hemi directory should then be accessible from your local Web server under /Hemi.

Refer to the wiki for detailed instructions.
